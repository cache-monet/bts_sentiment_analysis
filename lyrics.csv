Love Yourself Her,2017,INTRO: Serendipity,"All this is no coincidence
Just, just, by my feeling
The whole world is different from yesterday
Just, just, with your joy

When you called me
I became your flower
As if we were waiting
We bloom until we ache

Maybe it’s the providence of the universe
It just had to be that
You know, I know
You are me, I am you

As much as my heart flutters, I’m worried
The destiny is jealous of us
Just like you I’m so scared
When you see me, when you touch me

The universe has moved for us
Without missing a single thing
Our happiness was meant to be
Cuz you love me, and I love you

You’re my penicillium, saving me, saving me
My angel, my world
I’m your Calico cat, here to see you
Love me now, touch me now

Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Since the creation of the universe
Everything was destined
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)

Let me love, let me love you
Let me love, let me love you"
Love Yourself Her,2017,DNA,"[Verse 1: V]
At first sight, I could recognize you
As if we were calling for each other
The DNA in my blood vessels tell me
That it’s you I was looking all over for

[Verse 2: J-Hope, RM]
Our meeting is like a mathematical formula
Commandments of religion, providence of the universe;
The evidence of destiny given to me
You’re the source of my dream
Take it, take it
My hand reaching out to you is my chosen fate

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Don’t worry, love
None of this is a coincidence
We’re totally different, baby
Because we’re the two who found our destiny

[Chorus: Jimin]
From the day of the universe’s creation and beyond
Through the infinite centuries and beyond
In the previous life and maybe the next too
We’re eternally together

[Hook: Jungkook]
None of this is a coincidence
Because we’re the two who found our destiny
DNA

[Verse 3: Suga, RM]
I want it this love I want it real love
I only focus on you
You steer me a little harder
The DNA of the genesis wants you
This is inevitable, I love us
We are the only true lovers

[Verse 4: Jungkook, Suga]
Every time I see her, I freak out
Surprisingly, I keep gasping and it’s weird, maybe
This is the emotion they call love
Because from the very beginning, my heart runs to you

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Don’t worry, love
None of this is a coincidence
We’re totally different, baby
Because we’re the two who found our destiny

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
From the day of the universe’s creation and beyond
Through the infinite centuries and beyond
In the previous life and maybe the next too
We’re eternally together

[Hook: Jungkook]
None of this is a coincidence
Because we’re the two who found our destiny
DNA

[Bridge: V, Jin, Jungkook, Jimin]
Don’t look back
Because we're the two who found our destiny
Don’t regret it, baby
Because we're forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
We are together

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Don’t worry, love
None of this is a coincidence
We’re totally different, baby
Because we’re the two who found our destiny

[Outro: J-Hope, Jungkook]

La la la la la
Because it’s not a coincidence

Love Yourself Her,2017,Best Of Me,"[Intro: Jimin, Jungkook]
When you say that you love me
I walk above the clouds
Tell me about eternity just one more time
When you say that you love me
All I need is that one phrase
That you’ll never change, just one more time

[Bridge: Jin, V]
You're like the whole world to me
Hug me harder and more painfully
That something that we shared
And you can’t make it nothing
I hope you don’t forget
That you’re my

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

[Hook 1: All]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
Even though I haven't seen my limits
But if it exists, It's probably you
I wanted to be the tender waves
But why didn’t I know you were the sea?
What do I do?
I speak with your language
And I breathe in your air
I’ll be you, I'll be in your grasp
As I kiss your sword

[Verse 2: Suga]
So take my hand right now
I don't believe that I'm like this
The words I've said to myself a million times
Please, don’t leave me
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
It's not important if it's a dream or reality
Only the fact that you're by my side
Thanks

[Chorus: V/Jin, Jin]
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you may be unaware

[Hook 1: All]

You’re my savior, you’re my window
All I need is you
You got the best of me
I need you
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Refrain 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
I used to rain
I used to snow
I stop all the misfortune
And I bring the heavens
Don't speak of it so lightly
There's no me without you
You’re the best of me
The best of me

[Refrain 2: J-Hope]
You just give me the confidence within myself
That's all I wanted
There may not be rules between us
But the way to love exists
Who got the best of me?
Who got the best of me?
No one knows but I know me
You are my best master

[Hook 1: All]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

I walk above the clouds
Tell me of eternity, just one more time

Love Yourself Her,2017,Dimple,"[Verse 1: V, Jimin]
You hide but only appear when you smile
Where did you come from?
Don’t lie, I know you’re an angel
What are you?

[Verse 2: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
But you
That smile is so cruel
Cruel
I shouldn’t have seen that cheek
You
What’s really dangerous
Is only in your possession

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin, V]
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes
So I call you illegirl ille~girl
Your existence alone is a crime
Was it a mistake made by an angel?
Or a deep kiss?
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway

[Verse 2: Jin, Jungkook]
I don’t have it, only you have it
Is that why it’s so hard?
I wanna die fallen in you, I wanna die locked in you
You are my lake

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, V, Jimin, Jin]
Cause you
When you smile, I get dizzy
True
Please be careful
You
What’s really dangerous
Is only in your possession

[Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes
So I call you illegirl ille~girl
Your existence alone is a crime
Was it a mistake made by an angel?
Or a deep kiss?
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway

[Bridge: V, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook]
Every time I see you, my heart gets dangerous
Every time I see you, it gets more dangerous
Oh baby no hey
Oh baby no hey
You’re too dangerous to live in this world

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin, V]
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes
So I call you illegirl ille~girl
Your existence alone is a crime
Was it a mistake made by an angel?
Or a deep kiss?
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway

Love Yourself Her,2017,Pied Piper,"[Verse 1: Jungkook]
It’s bad so it’s better
You know on the inside
You can’t stop it now (you can’t stop)
So be honest with me

[Verse 2: Rap Monster]
Stop
Now stop watching and study for your test
Your parents and boss hate me
Video clips, pictures, tweets
V app, Bon Voyage
I know, you can’t help what you like
But stop, interpret the music video later
You have so many pictures of me in your room anyway
It’s not just one hour, it’s a whole year that’ll disappear
So this song is an award I’m giving to you
Good

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, V]
You’re not being punished
Come here, I’m your paradise
Can’t close your eyes
Can’t close your eyes
You can throw a fit but it’s no use
(Don’t reject me)
Just close your eyes, tune your ears

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook]
Follow the sound of the pipe, follow this song
It’s a bit dangerous but I’m so sweet
I’m here to save you, I’m here to ruin you
You called me, see? I’m so sweet
Follow the sound of the pipe
I’m takin’ over you
I’m takin’ over you

[Verse 3: V, Suga]
You know that it’s already begun
The moment you hear that sound
Maybe I’m a bit dangerous
Like the pied piper
I’m testing you
Like the fruit from the tree of good and evil

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
My pipe awakens everything
That sound burns you up even more
You’re pulled by it, you react
I’m endlessly blowing
I’m your guilty pleasure
You can’t escape
Never

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
You’re not being punished
Come here, I’m your paradise
Can’t close your eyes
Can’t close your eyes
You can throw a fit but it’s no use
(Don’t reject me)
Just close your eyes, tune your ears

[Chorus: Jin, V]
Follow the sound of the pipe, follow this song
It’s a bit dangerous but I’m so sweet
I’m here to save you, I’m here to ruin you
You called me, see? I’m so sweet
Follow the sound of the pipe

[Bridge: Jungkook]
Yeah, I’m a bit dangerous
I can’t even handle myself
Don’t worry, my hands
They’re only warm for you

[Outro: Jimin, Jungkook]
If I’m ruining you right now
Please forgive me
Because you can’t live without me
Because you know all of this
I’m takin’ over you
I’m takin’ over you"

Several uncooked steaks over there make me mad
Once again, I’ll chew you all up, on the night of the stars

Haters are already giving up

My success is already so golden

You’re rushing to run away
How you dare

So many trophies in my hands
Too heavy, my hands aren’t enough

Lodi dodi, I’m so busy
Too busy, my one body isn’t enough
Mic drop

This is the the exact saying
Right will prevail in the end
Once upon a time
Aesop’s Fables, fly
Look at your reality, too bad
Even if I die now, I’m damn happy
Which country are we going to this time?
Spending hours on a plane
Yeah I’m on the mountain
Yeah I’m on the bay
Total exhaustion on the stage

Good luck

No need to see each other ever again, this is my last goodbye
Nothing more left to say, don’t even apologize
No need to see each other ever again, this is my last goodbye
Nothing more left to say, don’t even apologize

Look closely, look at your pathetic self
We shoot up just like coca cola
Your corneas will be so shocked
Cause we’re just so cool"

I want to be cruisin’ like Nemo
No money but I wanna go far away
I don’t have money but I wanna relax
No money but I wanna eat Jiro Ono’s sushi

Worked hard to get my pay
Gonna spend it all on my stomach
Pinching pennies to spend it all on wasting it
Leave me be, even if I overspend
Even if I break apart my savings tomorrow

There’s already a mortgage on my future
Woo spending my money even more

Love Yourself Her,2017,OUTRO: Her,"[Verse 1: RM]
The world is a complex
We wus lookin’ for love
I was just one of those people
Didn’t even believe in true love
Just said I wanted to be in love like a habit
But I found myself
The whole new myself
I’m confused too, which one’s the real me?
Did you figure out that I’m a book after I met you?
Or did you turn my page?
Damn
Anyway, I wanna be the best man for you
Of course, you’re the world to me
When you said you wanted to die with me
I promised to be the man you want, God I swore to myself
So many complex
But I’m lookin’ for love
I don’t care if it’s a fake me, if you hold me
You’re my beginning and my end
So you finish me

[Chorus: RM]
All of my wonder
You’re the answer
I call you her, her
'Cause you’re my tear, tear
All of my wonder
You’re the answer
I call you her, her
'Cause you’re my tear, tear

[Verse 2: Suga]
Maybe I’m your truth and your lie
Maybe I’m your love and hate
Maybe I’m your enemy and friend
Your heaven and hell, your pride and embarrassment
I can never take off the mask
Because the me behind this mask
Is not the one you know
Make up to wake up today too
And dress up to mask on
In order to become the me that you love
In order to become the one that you love
I quit the XX that I liked so much
Just for you
I put on clothes I hate, excessive make up
Because your laughter and happiness is the scale of my happiness
This is how I am, do I deserve your love?
I always make an effort to be the best for you
I hope you don’t know this part of me

[Chorus: Suga]
All of my wonder
You’re the answer
I call you her, her
'Cause you’re my tear, tear
All of my wonder
You’re the answer
I call you her, her
'Cause you’re my tear, tear

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Just like always, mask on
Greeting me with cheers, her
I’m your star, I shine as if nothing’s wrong
But the moment I should shine the most, I take my mask off
Lost star, I’m laying down my burdens, enjoying the darkness
There’s no lights to shoot at me as if it’s killing me
Just going wherever my heart goes
However my senses lead me, whatever doesn’t hold me down
Tick tock the dark is over
Once again, to be your best
I’m holding onto myself
Love makes a person go crazy
Yeah, this is a crazy guy’s determination
Substituting myself to be the most me
For you, who is my everything, I’m giving you the answer I came up with
But you love that
So through that, I’m making an effort
With your existence, I find new meaning and the night shines
Now I know, even after the darkness
To me, you are the morning
You woke me up

[Chorus: J-Hope]
All of my wonder
You’re the answer
I call you her, her
'Cause you’re my tear, tear
All of my wonder
You’re the answer
I call you her, her
'Cause you’re my tear, tear"

Love Yourself Her,2017,Sea,"[Intro: Jungkook]
Oh, ah, yeah

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
I just started walking and ended up at the sea
I’m looking at the coast from here
There’s endless sand and the rough wind
I’m still looking at a desert
I wanted to have the sea so I swallowed you up
But I’m even thirstier than before
Is what I know really the ocean?
Or a blue desert?

[Refrain: J-Hope]
I don’t know, I don’t know
If I'm feeling the waves right now, yeah
I don’t know, I don’t know
If I'm being chased by the sand wind, yeah
I don’t know, I don’t know
Is this the sea or the desert?
Is this hope or despair?
Is this real or fake? shit

[Pre-Chorus: J-Hope]
I know, I know, my hardship right now
I know, I know, I’ll overcome
I know, I know, open me up
It’s the place I can rely on
Think positive, I’m swallowing my dry spit
Even if I’m nervous, even if I’m in a desert
I’m in the beautiful Namib Desert

Where there is hope, there is always hardship
Where there is hope, there is always hardship
Where there is hope, there is always hardship
Where there is hope, there is always hardship

[Hook: V, Jungkook]
Where there is hope
You know, you know
You know, yeah yeah
Where there is hope
You know, you know
You know, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Suga]
I thought this was the ocean but it’s a desert
A medium-sized, ordinary idol was my second name
Countless people get cut from broadcast
But someone’s empty spot is our dream
They say some of these kids can’t make it cuz their agency is too small
I know, I know, I know too
Times when the seven of us had to sleep in one room
With foolish hope that tomorrow will be different before we fell asleep
We saw the mirage in the desert but we couldn’t grasp it
Praying that we’ll remain in this desert till the end
Praying that this isn’t truly our reality

[Verse 3: Suga]
In the end, we reached the mirage and it became our reality
The scary desert became the ocean with our blood, sweat and tears
But why is there this fear in between the happiness?
Because we know too well that this place is really a desert

[Refrain 2: Suga]
I don’t wanna cry
I don’t wanna rest
No, who cares if we rest a little?
No no no
I don’t wanna lose
It’s always a desert
I told you everything
Then I’ll just be more depressed

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Where there is hope, there is always hardship
Where there is hope, there is always hardship

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
Where there is hope
You know, you know
You know, yeah yeah
Where there is hope
You know, you know
You know, yeah yeah

Ocean, desert, the world
Everything, the same thing
Different name
I see ocean, l see desert
I see the world
Everything's, the same thing
With a different name
It’s life again

Where there is hope
You know you know you know yeah
Where there is hope
You know you know you know yeah

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook, Jimin]
Where there is hope, there is always despair
Where there is hope, there is always despair

We need to be in despair, for all our hardships
We need to be in despair, for all our hardships"
Love Yourself Tear,2018,INTRO: Singularity,"[Verse 1]
A sound of something breaking
I awake from sleep
A sound full of unfamiliarity
Try to cover my ears but can’t go to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
The pain in my throat gets worse
Try to cover it
I don’t have a voice
Today I hear that sound again

[Chorus]
It’s ringing again, that sound
A crack again on this frozen lake
I dumped myself into the lake
I buried my voice for you

[Verse 2]
Over the winter lake I was thrown
A thick ice has formed atop
A winter lake on which I was thrown away
A thick ice has formed
In the dream I shortly went into
My agonizing phantom pain is still the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Have I lost myself
Or have I gained you
I suddenly run to the lake
There’s my face in it

[Chorus]
Please don't say anything
Reach my hand out to cover the mouth
But in the end, spring will come someday
The ice will melt and flow away

[Chorus]
Tell me if my voice isn't real
If I shouldn’t have thrown myself away
Tell me if even this pain isn’t real
What I was supposed to do back then"
Love Yourself Tear,2018,Fake Love,"I've been spending all night long
Tryna find the memories for a love song
All them girls they on my phone
But I know that shit don't mean
Nothing at all (nothing at all)
I used to hear the sound of fear
That could stop me
But I've been dedicated to those
Who love me
And now I'm hella faded in my zone
Leaving all my past behind
My back though

I’m so sick of this
Fake love, fake love, fake love oh
I’m so sorry but it’s
Fake love, fake love, fake love oh

I wanna be a good man
Just for you
A fucking good man
Just for you
I don't want nothing
Just for you
Now I don't know me
Who are you?
Look, mama told me don't
Don't trust a clever girl
But I couldn't tell myself ""no""
And I just want, I just want more
Baby, cold hearted
Baby, you started
Faking the passionate love
Maybe you hottie
Maybe you naughty
But I'm sorry you hurt me enough

I've been spending all night long
Tryna find the memories for a love song
All them girls they on my phone
But I know that shit don't mean
Nothing at all (nothing at all)
I used to hear the sound of fear
That could stop me
But I've been dedicated to those
Who love me
And now I'm hella faded in my zone
Leaving all my past behind
My back though

Love you so bad, love you so bad
Love used to be so innocent with no lies
Love you so mad, love you so mad
But you just don't wanna compromise
All this time
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Love used to be so innocent with no lies
Love you so mad, love you so mad
But you just don't wanna compromise
All this time

I’m so sick of this
Fake love, fake love, fake love oh
I’m so sorry but it’s
Fake love, fake love, fake love oh"
Love Yourself Tear,2018,The Truth Untold,"[Verse 1: V]
Full of loneliness
This garden bloomed
Full of thorns
I bind myself in this sand castle

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
What is your name
Do you have a place to go
Oh could you tell me?
I saw you hiding in this garden

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
And I know
All of your warmth is real
The blue flower your hand was picking
I want to hold it but

[Chorus: Jimin]
It’s my fate
Don’t smile to me
Lie to me
Because I can’t get closer to you
There’s no name you can call me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
You know that I can’t
Show you me
Give you me
I can’t show you a ruined part of myself
Once again I put a mask on and go to see you
But I still want you

[Verse 3: Jin]
Bloomed in a garden of loneliness
A flower that resembles you
I wanted to give it to you
After I take off this foolish mask

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
But I know
I can't do that forever
I have to hide
Because I'm a monster

[Chorus: V]
I am afraid
I am shattered
I’m so afraid
That you will leave me again in the end
Once again I put on a mask and go to see you

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
The only thing I can do
In the garden
In this world
Is to bloom a pretty flower that resembles you
And to breathe as the me that you know
But I still want you
I still want you

[Chorus: Jin]
Maybe back then
A little
Just this much
If I had the courage to stand before you
Would everything be different now

[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
I'm crying
That’s disappeared
That’s fallen
Left alone in this sandcastle
Looking at this broken mask

[Outro: Jimin, Jungkook]
And I still want you
But I still want you
But I still want you
And I still want you"
Love Yourself Tear,2018,134340,"[Verse 1: V, Jungkook]
If only I could, I wanted to ask you
Why did you do that back then? Why did you kick me out?
Without a name to myself, I still revolve around you
Our goodbye is colorless, that unchanging color

[Verse 2: RM]
There’s no name allowed for me
I, too, used to be your star
You must feel nice to be the light
All I did was to receive you

What meaning is left of the fallen planet’s remaining life
I’ll receive it til I die, your stifling stare
I still orbit you, and nothing’s changed
If love has no name, everything has changed

Could it be really that you’ve found Eris
Tell me, how am I not as good as that moon
Us is the plural form of U
Maybe I wasn’t there from the start

Someday, you’ll also understand my words
My seasons were always you
My cold heart is 248 degrees below zero
It stopped the day you erased me
Damn

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Verse 3: Suga]
It’s not much different from yesterday ay
Same old days, except you’re not here
We were together just up until yesterday ay
But it’s to the point where it’s scary, same days but no you

I’ll be honest, even up until one year without you
I was fine, I didn’t have any feelings left
The last day I had forgotten
I don’t even remember your scent

But wait, I’ve smelled this perfume somewhere, ay
Just when my memory was about to come back
I turned my head around and saw you
You’re smiling brightly, but beside you there’s

Ah (Hello?) Hello
How are you? I’m doing okay
Unlike my heart, that feels like it’ll explode
The temperature right now is -248 degrees

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Bridge: Jin, J-Hope]
I’m just orbiting you
(Beyond the fog, I watch you as you continue to smile
Without you or anything
There’s no meaning to my irregular orbit)

I’m just going in circles
(I’m just a hard number to remember
And the Pluto of darkness
But I’ll continue to orbit around you forever, damn)

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)"
Love Yourself Tear,2018,낙원 (Paradise),"[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Marathon marathon
Life’s long so take it slow
42.195
The end is filled with a paradise of dreams

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jimin & Jungkook]
But the real world is
Different from what’s promised
We need to run, we need to step on it
If you shoot a flare
You don’t have a destination
There’s no sceneries at all
Until your breath comes up to your chin
You need to you need to

[Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
It’s alright to stop
There’s no need to run without even knowing the reason
It’s alright to not have a dream
If you have moments where you feel happiness for a while
It’s alright to stop
Now we don’t run without knowing the destination
It’s alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

[Verse 2: RM]
We borrow dreams from others (Like a debt)
We learn that we need to become great (Like a light)
Your dream. Is actually a burden
If having a future is the only dream existing
Then what is the dream you had last night in your bed?
It’s alright if the name of the dream is different
Be it buying a laptop next month
Or just eating and sleeping
Not doing anything at all yet still having a lot of money
Who says a dream must be something grand
Just become anybody
We deserve a life
Whatever big or small, you are you after all

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jimin & Jungkook]
But the real world is
Different from what’s promised
We need to run, we need to step on it
If you shoot a flare
You don’t have a destination
There’s no sceneries at all
Until your breath comes up to your chin
You need to you need to

[Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
It’s alright to stop
There’s no need to run without even knowing the reason
It’s alright to not have a dream
If you have moments where you feel happiness for a while
It’s alright to stop
Now we don’t run without knowing the destination
It’s alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

[Verse 3: Suga]
I don’t have a dream
To dream is sometimes scary
To just live like this
To survive like this is a small dream to me
To have a dream, to grasp a dream
To breathe, is sometimes too much to handle
Saying this person’s living like this, that person’s living like that
The world’s hurling at me

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
Yeah
The world doesn’t have the right to swear
What is the way to dream a dream
Since they never taught us that
In the made up dream, sleep-talk of tears
I wake you up from the nightmare for you
Now let’s try to smile everyday, in that paradise

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
It’s alright to stop
Now we don’t run without even knowing the destination
It’s alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

[Bridge: All]
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
Now stop that foolish race
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
You don’t need something like a dream that everyone dreams
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
Every language that makes you, is already in paradise"
Love Yourself Tear,2018,Love Maze,"[Intro: Jungkook]
Cause' I’ll be in love maze
Cause' I’ll be in love maze

[Verse 1: Jimin]
Trapped in a maze of decisions
Exhausted by all the different chaos
We’ve wandered around, looking for the answer
Lost in the maze, in the darkness

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We ran and ran endlessly
But all the fake noise
Can’t tear us apart
It’s true baby

[Refrain: Jimin, Jin]
We must believe only in ourselves
Can’t let go of each other’s hands
We need to be together forever

[Verse 3: RM]
People say
That I’ll end up a fool
But I don’t wanna use my head
I don’t wanna calculate
Love ain’t a business
Rather like a fitness
I’ve never been in a calculating love
I know it’ll be cold like winter
But I still wanna try
If you push me, I’ll fall, just raise me up again
Even if I pull, you don’t have to come
Let them be them
Let us be us
Love is a maze damn
But you is amaze yeah

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
My ay ay come closer
My ay ay never go away
In love maze

No matter what others say, don’t listen
Just let’em talk, whatever they say
The more they do, the more I’m sure
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Can’t you hear me, you have to trust me
Baby just don’t give a damn
Promise, promise me

[Verse 4: Suga]
All around us is a maze, different paths
We’re walking in this abyss
There’s a thin light over there
I hope we’re going toward paradise
Know this, sometimes lies will try to tear us apart
Hardships will try to deceive us but
Just focus on me then
In the darkness, just the two of us is enough
In all these lies
If we’re together, even an endless maze is paradise

[Chorus: Jin]
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
What can we do? We did the official thing
So we need to follow the rules
Even in this wandering maze
Even on this mysterious path
We’re taking care of each other
I always think, even if eternity is hard
I wanna try it, let’s be forever
Our own mountain, our own climb
Our own world, our own heart
Travel toward the exit
Held together, our hands become a map

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
My ay ay come closer
My ay ay never go away
In love maze"
Love Yourself Tear,2018,Magic Shop,"[Verse 1: V, Jungkook]
I know that you’re hesitating because even if you say the truth
In the end it will all return as scars
I’m not going to say anything blatant like “find strength”
I will let you hear my story, let you hear it

[Verse 2: RM]
What did I say?
I said you’d win, didn’t I?
I couldn’t believe it (really)
Could I win it?
This miracle that isn’t a miracle
Did we make it?
(No) I was here
You were the one that made your way to me
I do believe your galaxy
I want to listen to your melody
Your stars in the Milky Way
Don’t forget that I found you anyways
At the end of my despair
You’re the last reason
For me who was standing at the edge of the cliff
Live

On days I hate being myself, days I want to disappear forever
Let's make a door in your heart
Open the door and this place will await

While drinking a glass of hot tea
And looking up at the Milky Way
You’ll be alright, oh, this here is the Magic Shop

So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)

[Verse 3: J-Hope, Suga]
Like a rose when blooming
Like cherry blossoms when being scattered in the wind
Like morning glory when fading
Like that beautiful moment
I always want to be the best
So I was impatient and always restless
Comparing myself with others became my daily life
My greed that was my weapon suffocated me and also became a leash
But looking back on it now, truthfully
I feel like it’s not true that I wanted to be the best
I wanted to become your comfort and move your heart
I want to take away your sadness, and pain

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
On days where I hate myself for being me, on days where I want to disappear forever
Let's make a door. It's in your heart
Open the door and this place will await

Would you believe me if I said that I was scared of everything too?
All the sincerity, the remaining times
All your answers are in this place you found
In your Milky Way, inside your heart

[Chorus: All]
You gave me the best of me
So you'll give you the best of you
You found me. You knew me
You gave me the best of me
So you'll give you the best of you
You'll find it, the galaxy inside you

So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)

I don’t have biceps or pecs
I don’t have a super car like Batman
The ideal hero is my fantasy
But all I can give you is Anpan
I’ve dreamed of becoming a hero like Superman
I ran with all my strength, jumping high up in the sky
I’m not afraid of little things like bruising my knees
A innocent fantasies of my childhood

[Verse 2: Suga]
I’m not a superhero
Don’t expect a lot
I can be your hero

But mom, I really need to do it
Who’s gonna do it if it isn’t me?
You can call me, say Anpan

All I can give you is Anpan
And a word, ""You’ve worked hard,""

Love Yourself Tear,2018,OUTRO: Tear,"[Verse 1: RM]
Goodbyes are, for me, a tear
Without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
The words that I could not bring myself to say flow down
And lingering regret crawls over my face
To me, you were once my dear
But now you’re merely a bitter beer
My heart that’s stained with belated self-loathing
Becomes empty even with the passing breeze
At the end of my play where breakup was a lie
The price that I had to pay came to me
If someone said they would turn back the time for me
Would I have been able to be a bit more honest?
The bare face that only I know
The ugly and pathetic old friends within me
Would you still be able to love me again like before
With that smile with which you used look at me
Stop saying things like forever, forever
After all, the end originally exists
If there’s a start, I don’t wanna listen to that
Words that are too correct or too much consolation.. I don’t wanna listen to that
I was just so scared
Because it seemed like perhaps I had never loved you at all
Although it was late, that you were true
That only you loved me
More

[Chorus: RM]
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
What more can I say?
You’re my tear

[Verse 2: J-Hope, Suga]
We walked towards the same place
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

[Chorus: RM, Suga, J-Hope]
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my fear
You’re my, you’re my fear
What more can I say?
You’re my...

[Verse 3: Suga]
Goodbyes are T.E.A.R
Because things like tears are a luxury
There’s no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
So just begin now
Woo take it easy slowly carve out my heart
That’s right, that’s right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
So that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
Please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
That’s right, right there, what are you hesitating for
This is the ending you were wishing for
So go on and kill me without hesitating
Woo yeah yeah burn it
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
So not even the ashes remain

[Verse 4: Suga]
This is the real you and this is the real me
Now we’ve seen the end and not even resentment is left
I’ve woken up from the sweet dream and I close my eyes
This is the real you and this is the real me

[Verse 5: RM, Suga]
We walked towards the same place
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

[Chorus: RM, Suga, J-Hope]
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my fear
You’re my, you’re my fear
What more can I say?
You’re my...

[Bridge: Suga]
What should I say
We know
The answer is fixed
But replying is always hard

[Verse 6: J-Hope]
Why are you spilling it
Why are you tearing it up
It’s useless, to me
Goodbye to me is only those moments (Flashback)
The moment you say words from your mouth
The moment our focus becomes irregular
At the moment where everything is dangerous
Our end that two letters handed to us
That I won’t cry, that I won’t tear it up
I can’t say those kinds of words. In the future I, too
Breakup, incurable disease
You’re my beginning and my end, That is all
My meeting and my farewell
You were everything, step forward fear
It will be repeated, caused by you
Tear
Tear"
Map Of The Soul: PERSONA,2019,INTRO: Persona,"Who am I? The question I had my whole life
The question which I probably won’t find an answer to my whole life
If I were answerable with a few more words
Then God wouldn’t have created all these various beauties
How you feel? How’re you feeling right now?

Actually I’m real good but a little uncomfortable
I'm still not so sure if I'm a dog or a pig or what else
But then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
Ptui!
I laugh more than I did before
I dreamt of becoming a superhero
Now it feels like I really became one
But as it goes on there’s so much blabbering
One says, ""Run"" another says, ""Stop""
This one says, ""Look at the forest"" that one says, ""Look at the wild flower""

My shadow, I wrote and called it hesitation
It has never hesitated after becoming that
It keeps appearing under the stage or the light
Keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (Oh shit)
Hey, have you already forgotten why you even started this
You were just digging it that someone was listening
Sometimes everything sounds like freakin' nonsense
You know what comes out of you when you're drunk.. like immaturity

Someone like me ain't good enough for music
Someone like me ain't good enough for the truth
Someone like me ain't good enough for a calling
Someone like me ain't good enough to be a muse
The flaws of mine that I know
Maybe that's all I've got really
The world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all
The regrets that I don't even get sick of anymore
I tumble with them every night until I'm disgusted
And twist the irreversible time habitually
There's something that raised me up again every time
The first question
The three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those

So I'm askin' once again yeah
Who the hell am I?
Tell me all your names baby
Do you wanna die?
Oh do you wanna go?
Do you wanna fly?
Where's your soul? where's your dream?
Do you think you're alive?
I don't know man
But I know one thing
My name is RM

The 'me' that I remember and people know
The 'me' that I created myself to vent out
Yeah maybe I have been deceiving myself
Maybe I've been lying
But I'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
Dear myself
You must never lose your temperature
Cuz you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
Though I might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil
This is the barometer of my direction I want to keep
The 'me' that I want myself to be
The 'me' that people want me to be
The 'me' that you love
And the 'me' that I create
The 'me' that's smiling
The me that's sometimes in tears
Vividly breathing each second and every moment even now

Persona
Who the hell am I
I just wanna go
I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you all the voices till I die
I just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry

Persona
Who the hell am I
I just wanna go
I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you all the voices till I die
I just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry"

Twinkling starlight
Building with blinking light
We're shining brightly
In our own rooms, in our own stars

[Verse 2: J-Hope, RM, Suga]
One light is ambition
Some light is rebellion
People's lights
All are precious
This dark night (Don't be lonely)
Like stars (We shine)
Don't disappear
'Cause you're a big existence
Let us shine

Perhaps the reason this night looks so beautiful
Is not because of these stars or lights, but us

You got me
I dream while looking at you
I got you
Inside those pitch black nights
The lights we saw in each other
Were saying the same thing

Starlight that shines brighter in the darkest night
Starlight that shines brighter in the darkest night
The deeper the night, the brighter the starlight

One history in one person
One star in one person
7 billion different worlds
Shining with 7 billion lights

Our own dreams, let us shine
You shine brighter than anyone else

Map Of The Soul: PERSONA,2019,Make It Right,"[Verse 1: V]
The moment I noticed myself
I had to leave
I had to find out
All day all night

[Verse 2: Jimin]
Across the desert and the sea
This wide, wide world
I wandered
Baby I

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, V]
I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
On that long road
Oh you're the light
Uninvited
Unwelcome
The only one who recognized me

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
This eternal night with no end in sight
It's you who gifted me the morning
Can I now hold that hand?
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Post-Chorus: V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
I became a hero in this world
The loud screams that seek me out
My hand, trophy and a gold microphone
All day, everywhere
But all of this is about reaching you
It's the answer to my journey
I'm singing to find you
Baby to you

[Verse 4: RM]
A little taller than I was before
With a voice a little more solid
All of this to go back to you
Now I'll spread wide a map called you
My rehab
Look at me, why can't you recognize me?
I don't want to hear other people's noises
Your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
Let's go back to that time

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
All those roads
Are pointing to you

[Verse 5: Jimin]
Everything was useless
Anything other than you
Just touch me like that time

This eternal night with no end in sight
It's you who gifted me the morning
Now can I hold that hand?
Oh oh
I can make it right

Oh I can make it right

All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Bridge: Suga]
You are still beautiful
Just hold me silently like you did that day, that time
The reason I survived in hell
It's for you, it was not for me
If you know, don't hesitate and please save my life
I'm thirsty wandering this desert without you
So hurry and grab me quickly
I know the sea without you is the same as a desert

All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right

Map Of The Soul: PERSONA,2019,Home,"[Intro: RM]
I'm exhausted man
Oh, guess what?
I just want to go home

[Verse 1: Jimin, RM]
In this excitement that's driving me crazy
I wasn't even able to greet you (yeah, right)
Yeah I´m going out baby
The whole world is my home

[Verse 2: V, RM]
Crazy for myself (yeah)
Like everything would work out when I opened that door (right)
Like I was about to show something (uh huh)
I left home
(Hoping all this imagination doesn't end as illusions)

[Verse 3: RM]
Oh yeah I did it, me shine with flashin' lights
Got lotta friends, my quiet personal space
Yeah, I remember when I thought I could do everything
I saw the ocean, yeah, before I opened this door
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
Whatever I fill becomes emptier
The more we're together, I feel lonelier
Half-closed eyes, sleepless light
The place where you are

[Chorus: V, Jin, RM]
That place is probably Mi Casa
With you I'mma feel rich (yeah)
That place is no other than Mi Casa
Turn it on, your switch (switch)
Yeah

It's comfortable even as you say nothing
With you, anywhere will be my home
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that

Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la la la I love it

[Verse 4: J-Hope, Suga]
My feet look strange in the entrance with lights off
I still feel strange as I close my eyes inside my blanket
I feel like I'm floating, both eyes spinning
In this fabulous space, I feel completely shabby

[Verse 5: Suga]
Totally shabby
The world thinks we own the whole world
Even if we have what I wanted in my dreams
Big house, big cars, big rings
The unfamiliar feeling of missing something
For someone who has accomplished everything
But I go out the door since I know I have something to return to

[Bridge: Jin]
I keep remembering you between crossroads
You knew me when I had nothing else
I could smile at the thought of you
The place where you are

[Chorus: Jimin, V, RM]
That place is probably Mi Casa
With you I'mma feel rich (yeah)
That place is no other than Mi Casa
Turn it on, your switch (switch)
Yeah

It's comfortable even as you say nothing
If you are there, they'll all be my home
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Verse 6: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
One day
Will you open the door for me
When the doorbell rings three times
So that I could give the parting words
That I did not finish
I'll tell you then

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
It's been a while, Mi Casa
With you I just feel rich
I'm back, hi, Mi Casa
You left it on, your switch (switch)
Yeah

It's comfortable even as you say nothing
It became my home because you were there
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that

You look like you're mad
In a blur, game over over over

If this was a game
I could just load it again
I guess I gotta deal with this, deal with this
Real world

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
It'd be better if it was a game
Because it hurts so much
I need to heal my medic
But I'm another star
Blame myself since I was imperfect
Brake in my head, brake in my step, always
All I wanted was to do well
I wanted to make you smile, damn

Please give me a remedy
A remedy to make my heart beat again

What should I do now
Please save me, give me another chance
Please give me

A remedy, a melody
A memory that will be left just for me
If I stop right now
If I just turn it off, will all will be more comfortable?

I'm fine but I'm not fine
I told myself I was used to it
It always hurts like it's the first time

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
Not a good gamer, that's right, you can't control me
It keeps hurting 'cause of trial and error and 50,000-something else
My song lyrics, each gesture
I become afraid of every word, my jamais vu
Again, I try to escape as always
But still, you grab me
Even as my shadow grows
My life and yours are an equal sign
So my remedy is your remedy

Please give me a remedy
A remedy that will make my heart beat again

What should I do now
Please save me, give me another chance

What should I do now
Please save me, give me another chance

Please give me a remedy

A remedy that will make my heart beat again

What should I do now?

Save me
